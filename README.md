This repository powers the [PayID.org](https://payid.org) web application built using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Clone the payid.org repository.**

    Use git to pull down the payid.org repository.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/payid-org/payid.org.git
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into payid.org's directory, install the packages, and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd payid.org/
    npm i
    npm run start
    ```

3.  **Start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in the PayID.org repository.

    .
    ├── .vscode
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .prettierrc.js
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── package.json
    ├── package-lock.json
    └── tailwind.config.js

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that our project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed when using the `npm i` command.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of payid.org (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.prettierrc.js`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

4.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

5.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

6. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

7. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed. **(You won’t change this file directly).**
