1.  **`/.github`**: This directory contains github configuration files such as the `CODEOWNERS` file.

2.  **`/.vscode`**: This directory contains the recommended vscode extensions and settings for the editor.

3.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that our project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed when using the `npm i` command.

4.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of PayID.org. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

5.  **`/static`**: This directory contains any files or assets that will be accessible at the root of https://payid.org. For instance favicon.ico can be accessed at https://payid.org/favicon.ico.

6.  **`.dockerignore`**: This is a configuration file for [Docker](https://docker.com/). Dockerignore tells our docker build to exclude certain directories from the docker container.

7.  **`.gitignore`**: This is a configuration file for git. The gitignore tells us which files to exclude in our committed source code.

8.  **`.gitlab-ci.yml`**: This is a configuration file for [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html). This is the required steps that sets up our continuous deployment as well as tests our code to ensure our code meets basic standards before being merged into github.

9.  **`Dockerfile`**: This is a configuration file for [Docker](https://docker.com/). The Dockerfile tells the docker container how to process and deploy the code.

10.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

11.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. We specify information about PayID.org like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins we include, etc. (Check out the [gatsby config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

12.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

13.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

14.  **`README.md`** This the code that hosts the helpful content you are reading right now.

15.  **`tailwind.config.js`**: This is the main css configuration file that holds all of our theming configuration. This is for the [CSS framework tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) which we use for PayID.org.

16.  **`tsconfig.js`**: This is the configuration file for our typescript configuration. We use a strict configuration that doesn't allow any loose typings in order to maintain a high code quality.
