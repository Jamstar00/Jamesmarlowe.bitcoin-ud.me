              PayID works across jurisdictions â€” without a patchwork of central
              registration. Any business that sends and receives money can use
              PayID to give each of their customers a simple and universal ID
              that works across any payment network and makes payments faster
              and easier. PayID is an open and free standard, so anyone can
              build implementations and extensions on top of PayID.

PayID provides a simple extension that helps businesses satisfy Travel Rule record-keeping required in jurisdictions globally, including both current FinCEN rules and FATF guidance. Protocol extensions also make it easy to comply with a variety of other requirements for transactions involving regulated entities, while PayID also facilitates other compliance needs, such as sanctions screening.',
