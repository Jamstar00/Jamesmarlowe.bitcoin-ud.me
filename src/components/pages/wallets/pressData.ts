    description: `PayID, a free and open standard designed to replace account numbers that are designed to be interoperable and easier to understand — easy enough that Ripple envisions people typing the account name by memory, something that people rarely do for driver's license numbers and other common identifiers. Ripple's standard could remove the need for two people to use the same payment app for P2P transfers... The PayID standard allows people on different transfer apps to connect with
        each other.`,

    description: `Email is a popular technology in part because it doesn't matter which service you use. A Gmail user can send a message to someone with a Yahoo account and vice versa. Yet when it comes to sending cash on the Internet, services are fractured. A Venmo user can't send money to someone using Cash App or Zelle, and nor can you can use a bank's website to send money to those apps. That's why a new service called PayID is intriguing… PayID offers consumers the equivalent of an email address—a distinct easy-to-read ID that works with any service provider.`,
